# glitch.css
glitch.css makes nice cyperpunky glitch effects.
## How To Use
Include the glitch libary before the `</head>` tag.
```
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/glitch.min.css">
</head>
```
Add the `glitch` and the desired glitch effect class a div. In the div a minimum of one `<h1>` and a max of three should be added as children to the div.
```
<div class="glitch glitch1">
  <h1>GLITCHED TEXT</h1>
  <h1>GLITCHED TEXT</h1>
  <h1>GLITCHED TEXT</h1>
</div>
```
Replace `glitch1` with desired glitch effect class. All available glitch classes can be previewed on [link here].
